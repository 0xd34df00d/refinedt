{-
This module lists requirements on an Oracle
needed to prove that the translation is well-behaved.

Since the properties here depend both on typing derivations in Intermediate.Derivations.*
as well as on the translation function definitions in Translation.Typed,
they cannot be (easily) defined in Intermediate.Oracle without introducing circular deps.
Hence, they are defined separately here.
